## Hosting 

You can use [render.com](https://render.com) to host your own private instance. Create a web service and import the GitHub repository. Add the necessary environment variables and deploy. You also need to create a blueprint in render using the existing render.yaml in this repo. Just sync it with your bot instance. Now, go to [cron-jobs](https://cron-job.org/en/) website and create a new ping service using the flask web server url obtained from render's dashboard.

> [!TIP]
> Custom emojis not working? Add your emojis to the bot from developer portal and edit the [config.py](https://github.com/Richard0070/Melody-Discord-Bot/blob/main/config.py) file.
